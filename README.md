## Another attempt on getting a useful hiveOS integration
Just another qliClient hiveOS integration compatible with dual mining (CPU + GPU).

Based on a "cleaned" version of Eloworld (https://github.com/EloWord/hiveos).

Culprit to have dual mine was to launch two qliClient with a unique process, so I just modified the h-run.sh to run an unique shellscript that launch 2 qliClient instances.
h-stats.sh was also adapted to get the statistics working.

The release contains all scripts, the only binary in the package is the qliClient.
Feel free to test & use, no fees, but you can buy me a coffee or a lambo : XRZWBAQPOYBISFSBIJARFWFKTMGBKQLMIWBVCHEYLBJBCEVJBRLOHUNEBCYC

## Last Release
v7-beta with qli-Client v 1.8.9
